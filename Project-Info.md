# Media Manager React

## Goals and Aims

This project aims to make a complete media management tool in HTML/CSS/JS, utilising the MERN stack of technologies. It aims to be a tool for complete media management including (but not limited too) videos (aimed at films), audio (aimed at music) and photos. The baseline goal is to have a system that display and play these media formats.

### Stretch goals

* If there is time I would also like to investigate streaming these media types over a network (investigating technologies such as rsync).
* Downloading meta data such as cover art/images for music and films
* Downloading review scores from RYM (rate your music) IMDB (internet movie database)
